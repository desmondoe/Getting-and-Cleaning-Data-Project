###Summary of Data Set Information
The experiments of a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

###What was captured using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope (smartphone)
 * 3-axial linear acceleration 
 * 3-axial angular velocity  
 Dataset obtained was partitioned into two sets: 70% for training data and 30% for the test data.
 
###Attribute Information
1. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
2. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
3. A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
4. Its activity label.
5. An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

###Identifiers
Subject - The ID of the test subject
Activity - Type of activity performed while measurements were taken
Measurement - what was measured - MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION: 3-axial linear acceleration, 3-axial angular velocity.

###Activity Labels (DATA SET INFORMATION)
1. WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
4. SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
5. STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
6. LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test

###STEP ONE (MERGE):  Training + Test Sets =  Data set.
After setting the source directory for the files, read into tables the data located in the following
- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

## Files from the Dataset
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

## The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second

##Features Info
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
